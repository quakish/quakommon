<group name="_decal" color="0.000000 1.000000 0.000000">
Compiler-only entity that specifies a decal to be projected. Should contain 1 or more patch meshes (curves) and target an info_null entity. Patch mesh should be using a shader with &quot;polygonoffset&quot; (or other blending methods) or z-fighting will occur. The distance between the center of the _decal entity and the target is the axis and distance of projection.

Compiler-only entity that specifies the origin of a skybox (a wholly contained, separate area of the map), similar to some games portal skies. When compiled with Q3Map2, the skybox surfaces will be visible from any place where sky is normally visible. It will cast shadows on the normal parts of the map, and can be used with cloud layers and other effects.

<group name="func_bobbing" color="0.200000 0.400000 0.600000">
Solid entity that oscillates back and forth in a linear motion. By default, it will have an amount of displacement in either direction equal to the dimension of the brush in the axis in which it&apos;s bobbing. Entity bobs on the Z axis (up-down) by default. It can also emit sound if the &quot;noise&quot; key is set.
-------- NOTES --------
In order for the sound to be emitted from the entity, it is recommended to include a brush with an origin shader at its center, otherwise the sound will not follow the entity as it moves. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

Target this entity with a misc_model to have the model attached to the entity (set the model&apos;s &quot;target&quot; key to the same value as this entity&apos;s &quot;targetname&quot;).

<group name="func_breakable" color="0.250000 0.500000 0.500000">
A breakable thing just sits there, doing nothing, 
but will break if damaged or collided with.
-------- NOTES --------
 - For glass windows that break easily, set health to 1.
 - Any func_breakable with a health of less than 10 will slowly weaken if a player is in contact with it.  You can make a roof that collapses in after a period of time by setting the health to a value like 5.  This will mean that a player standing on such a surface for around 5 seconds will fall thru.  The effect is cumulative: if you stand there for 3 seconds and then come back you can only stand on it for another 2 seconds.
 - The type parameter selects the shader that is used for fragments and sets the sound the object makes when it breaks.
 - If the brush you are making is on an angle (for example, a skylight in a sloping roof) then you will need to set the break axis to &quot;4&quot; if you want it to break when people stand on it.
 - You can build anything to break using the breakables. You can make a model breakable without having to use the model2 key. Just right click with it selected and choose func_breakable.
 - Set shards as high as you want (it maxes out at 32 anyway) - players can reduce the number of shards they see using cg_maxFragments
 - Bombable key is to be used for things that can only be broken by the Bomb Mode bomb explosion. For example a large propane tank near a bomb target. The key&apos;s value will determine the size of the explosion graphics from this entity when broken, with a value of 1 being no explosion and a value of 255 being a large secondary blast.
 - Type values info for 1,2,3,4 - The game will attenuate the damage caused by each hit to a value of 1-3. Health values above 10 will choose a random health between 6 and 10. Specifics are as follows: 0: is for glass/windows 1: is for all woods 2: is for ceramics and pottery 3: is for various plastics 4: is for metal that can be broken by normal means
 - Type values info for 5,6,7,8,9,10 - The game will use the literal health value compared to the weapon damages. They should be set quite high (metals and stone at 50+). Specifics are as follows: 5: is for metal that requires explosives to break (HE grenade or hk69) 6: is for metal that requires the hk69 to break 7: is for stone that requires explosives to break (HE grenade or hk69) 8: is for stone that requires the hk69 to break 9: is for wood that requires explosives to break (HE grenade or hk69) 10: is for wood that requires the hk69 to break

<group name="func_door" color="0.500000 0.300000 0.000000">
Normal sliding door entity.
-------- NOTES --------
To use the CloseWhenIdle setting for CTF Spawn Room doors, you must also set trigger_only, and use a trigger_multiple to open the door. This will cause the door to remain open only as long as a player is in the triggering brush.  Set the &apos;wait&apos; key on the trigger_multiple to a very low value( &lt; 1 like .25 )
If you want doors to operate together, you have to team them manually by assigning the same team name to all of them. 
Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

Target this entity with a misc_model to have the model attached to the entity (set the model&apos;s &quot;target&quot; key to the same value as this entity&apos;s &quot;targetname&quot;). And you can connect a button with target it to open it and a model to target it to connect the model to it and have the model be opened by the button.

-------- DOOR TELEPORTERS -------- (Simple explanation)
If a object is set to move so fast that it moves from 1 of it points to the other in an instant and hits the player in it's travel it will "teleport" the player.
This teleport will move the player the FULL LENGHT OF THE BRUSH/DOOR that hits THEM, no matter where in it's travel path it hits. (Even if at the very end it will still send full length)
It will also allow the player to keep their speed and direction.
Speed: Over 1000000 tends to always work, higher makes no difference I think.
lip: Should be put as 0 most of the time. Since it can influence travel distance so keep this at 0 for easy distance calculation.
CloseWhenIdle: Tend to have a mini delay before it returns back so it is often suboptimal to use.
Instead: Use a target_relay and a target_delay set to wait 0.1! that then targets this entity and set wait to -1.
Warning: If the end destination is inside a solid object the player will get stuck in door without teleporting!
Warning2: Wall running can trick the game to think you would end up in a wall, same with curved walls/ramps. (Make sure to always test for this just!)
In general func_door and func_plat works best, but could probably use any func_ that can move fast.

<group name="func_pendulum" color="0.200000 0.400000 0.600000">
Solid entity that describes a pendulum back and forth rotation movement. Rotates on the X axis by default. Pendulum frequency is a physical constant based on the length of the beam and gravity.
-------- KEYS --------
You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity. The center of that brush will be the point through which the rotation axis passes. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. Pendulum will rotate along the X axis by default. Very crude operation: Pendulum cannot rotate along Z axis, the speed of swing (frequency) is not adjustable. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

<group name="func_plat" color="0.500000 0.300000 0.000000">
Rising platform the player can ride to reach higher places. Plats must always be drawn in the raised position, so they will operate and be lighted correctly but they spawn in the lowered position. The plat will stay in the raised position until the player steps off. There are no proper sounds for this entity, only beep noises. It will spawn in the game and work properly but it sounds silly (see notes).
-------- NOTES --------
By default, the total amount of vertical travel of a platform is implicitly determined by the overall vertical size of the brushes of which it&apos;s made minus the lip value. But if the &quot;height&quot; key is used, then the total amount of vertical travel of the plat will be exactly that value regardless of the shape and size of the plat and regardless of the value of the &quot;lip&quot; key. Using the &quot;height&quot; key is the best method for any kind of platforms and the only possible one for thin plats which need to travel vertical distances many times their own thickness. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

There is a way to make plats play proper sounds. Just create a sound\movers\plats folder under baseq3 and put 2 sounds named pt1_strt.wav and pt1_end.wav in it. Those can be the renamed sounds from the Q2 plats or renamed copies of the sound\movers\doors sounds you can extract from your pak0.pk3 file or new custom sounds if you&apos;re up to it. Thanks to Fragzilla for the tip.

May also be descending platform with negative "height" or according "lip" keys set.

-------- DOOR TELEPORTERS -------- (Simple explanation)
If a object is set to move so fast that it moves from 1 of it points to the other in an instant and hits the player in it's travel it will "teleport" the player.
This teleport will move the player the FULL LENGHT OF THE BRUSH/DOOR that hits THEM, no matter where in it's travel path it hits. (Even if at the very end it will still send full length)
It will also allow the player to keep their speed and direction.
Speed: Over 1000000 tends to always work, higher makes no difference I think.
lip: Should be put as 0 most of the time. Since it can influence travel distance so keep this at 0 for easy distance calculation.
CloseWhenIdle: Tend to have a mini delay before it returns back so it is often suboptimal to use.
Instead: Use a target_relay and a target_delay set to wait 0.1! that then targets this entity and set wait to -1.
Warning: If the end destination is inside a solid object the player will get stuck in the door without teleporting!
Warning2: Wall running can trick the game to think you would end up in a wall, same with curved walls/ramps. (Make sure to always test for this just!)
In general func_door and func_plat works best, but could probably use any func_that can move fast.

<group name="func_ut_train" color="0.600000 0.100000 0.800000">
A train is a mover that moves between path_ut_stop target points.
This entity is partly broken BUT can be made to function as a basic train with multiple path locations.
But avoid using this unless you know what you are doing or want to mess around and debug weird things!
-------- NOTES --------
- Trains MUST HAVE AN ORIGIN BRUSH!
- The train spawns at the first target it is pointing at!
- Crusher will always be active and is not possible to turn off!
- To use more than 1 train you need to give all trains a different id, and make sure the id only uses NUMBERS! (integer)
- You can start a train to go to a path_ut_stop by triggering that path_ut_stop assuming it as the same id as the train or by triggering it's targetname
- Trains in a loop cannot be stopped!
- If a train that is manually triggered returns to a path_ut_stop it has already visited it will desync it's physical and visual locations!
- In short, don't use trains in serious maps unless you know what you are doing!

keyboard menu interface
The actual interface does not work in urt!
Left in since it can still have some minor interactions with func_ut_train. But avoid using this!

This could be used to start a assigned train without a button tho but comes with multiple side effects:
 - Will spawn a visual point for the 0 0 0 coordinate of the map
 - Will spawn as a solid invisible object.
 - Pressing use on this will start the train with same id

Don't use this in serious maps unless you really, like really, know what you are doing!!

Spawning position for Urban Terror team game modes.
You still need info_player_deathmatch or info_player_start in the map to be able to spawn.

You would use the groups key in maps if you wanted to make sure a team will spawn together in a certain location, so you might take 8 spawn points, give them all gametypes of &quot;3, 5, 6, 7, 8&quot; (all teamplays except gametype 4 TS, gametype 4 should be in separate groups for each team) and then assign all eight a group id of &quot;1&quot; then you might do another eight and make their group id all &quot;2&quot;. Then do the same for the other team e.g.: 8 spawns for both red and blue teams with group 1 and another 8 spawns for both red and blue teams with group 2. UT will choose a &quot;group&quot; at the begining of a round and spawn all members of the &quot;teams&quot; there. Normally you&apos;d have a few groups of spawns so you could have lots of potential team starting positions. Note: The game treats TS (gametype 4) spawns differently. It chooses the spawns based on furthest distance from each other rather than in paired groups. So if you wanted two spawn areas for each team you would do team blue group 1, team red group 2, team blue group 3, team red group 4.

Portal camera. This camera is used to project its view onto a portal surface in the level through the intermediary of a misc_portal_surface entity. Use the "angle", "angles" keys or target a target_position or info_notnull entity to set the camera's pointing direction.
-------- NOTES --------
Both the setting "angle(s)" key or "targeting a target_position" methods can be used to aim the camera. In both cases, the "roll" key must be used to set the roll angle. If either the SLOWROTATE or FASTROTATE spawnflag is set, then the "roll" value is irrelevant.
-------- KEYS --------
<angle key="angle" name="Yaw Angle">Yaw aiming angle of the portal camera (default 0).</angle>
<angles key="angles" name="Pitch Yaw Roll">This sets the pitch and yaw aiming angles of the portal camera (default 0 0). Use "roll" key to set roll angle.</angles>
<target key="target" name="Target">Point this to a target_position entity to set the camera's pointing direction.</target>
<targetname key="targetname" name="Target Name">A misc_portal_surface portal surface indicator must point to this.</targetname>
<real key="roll" name="Roll" value="0">Roll angle of camera. For axial directions a value of 0 is upside down and 180 is the same as the player's view. For other sorts of directions values of 90 and -90 may work (inconsistent math).</real>

<point name="misc_portal_surface" color="1 .5 .25" box="-8 -8 -8 8 8 8">
Portal surface indicator. This will "lock on" the brush face closest to it and identify as a portal. The view displayed on the portal surface is the view of the misc_portal_camera that this entity targets. Also used for mirrors (see notes).
-------- NOTES --------
The entity must be no farther than 64 units away from the portal surface to lock onto it.
To make a mirror, apply the common/mirror shader to the surface, place this entity near it but don't target a misc_portal_camera.
To make a portal, you need to use a shader with "alphagen portal", for instance textures/sfx/portal_sfx.

This can be used to create jump pads and launch ramps. The direction of push can be set by the &quot;angles&quot; key or pointing to a target_position or info_notnull entity. Unlike trigger_push, this is NOT client side predicted and must be activated by a trigger.
-------- NOTES --------
To make a jump pad or launch ramp, create a trigger_multiple where the jump must originate. Place the target_push directly above the trigger_multiple and place the target_position entity at the highest point of the jump. Target the trigger_multiple to the target_push and target the target_push to the target_position/info_notnull (or set the target_push&apos;s &quot;angles&quot; key).

Sound generating entity that plays .wav files. Normal non-looping sounds play each time the target_speaker is triggered. Looping sounds can be set to play by themselves (no activating trigger) or be toggled on/off by a trigger.
-------- NOTES --------
The path portion value of the &quot;noise&quot; key can be replaced by the implicit folder character &quot;*&quot; for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For example, if you want to create a &quot;bottomless pit&quot; in which the player screams and dies when he falls into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the &quot;noise&quot; key to &quot;*falling1.wav&quot;. The * character means the current player model&apos;s sound folder. So if your current player model is Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create &quot;player-specific&quot; triggered sounds in your levels.

The combination of the &quot;wait&quot; and &quot;random&quot; keys can be used to play non-looping sounds without requiring an activating trigger but both keys must be used together. The value of the &quot;random&quot; key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

Warning, if a lot of these are used in a big jump map it can cause problems! (200+) [combined with some other target_* entities, like target_location]

LOOPED sounds are globally loaded meaning even if no player is in the active area the sound will not reset.
Where as if you do use a combination of &apos;wait&apos; and &apos;random&apos; key the entity is not globally loaded and will be reset if no player is in the area to key the entity loaded.

<group name="trigger_multiple" color="0.000000 0.700000 0.700000">
Variable size repeatable trigger. It will fire the entities it targets when touched by player. Can be made to operate like a trigger_once entity by setting the &quot;wait&quot; key to -1. It can also be activated by another trigger that targets it.
-------- NOTES --------
Set the &apos;wait&apos; key to .25 if using the CloseWhenIdle key when triggering a door.
Do not set the &apos;wait&apos; key to 0 as it causes the trigger to malfunction and not trigger again most of the time after one activation.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

IMPORTANTS FOR RUN TIMERS:
Set wait to 0.1
Also try to split this trigger entity in multiple entities over the start line.
Bcs when a player is inside the trigger it will not trigger for any other players until they have exited and the wait time has passed!

Spawn location for the CTF Spawn Room Sentry Cannon.
-------- NOTES --------
Mr. Sentry is designed to be used in conjunction with CTF Spawn Rooms (see the Notes on the func_door entity) to prevent enemy team players from surviving if they enter the opposing team&apos;s spawn room. Even though the properly set up doors will generally prevent this, Mr. Sentry also has one other function. It will kill any Flag Carrier that enters it&apos;s range no matter what team that player is on. This will prevent players from grabbing the flag and retreating the the complete safety of their Spawn Room and waiting out the rest of the map time with the flag.

For the anti-flag-camp feature to work properly, the entire spawn room must be enclosed with a &apos;nodrop&apos; (a brush with the &apos;nodrop&apos; texture on all sides). If this brush (or group of brushes) isn&apos;t placed, then Mr. Sentry will kill the Flag Carrier, and the flag will remain at that location, which is bad.
